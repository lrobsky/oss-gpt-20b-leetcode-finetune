# oss-gpt-20b-leetcode-finetune
This repository contains the code and training workflow for a finetuned version of [oss-gpt-20b](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gpt-oss-20b), specialized for solving LeetCode-style coding problems.

The model was finetuned using [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) on the [LeetCode Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/newfacade/LeetCodeDataset).

## Notes  
- The model weights are not stored in this GitHub repo due to size limits.  
  You can find them on Hugging Face through the links below.
- Currently, this model cannot be exported to GGUF.
  For inference outside Python, you will need GGUF support, which is not available for oss-gpt-20b QLoRA adapters using Unsloth yet.

## Repository Contents

- `gpt_oss_(20B)_Fine_tuning.ipynb` â€“ notebook used for finetuning with Unsloth.  
- `inference_example.py` â€“ example script showing how to load the model from Hugging Face and run it on a LeetCode problem.  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ dependencies for local inference.

## Quickstart

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lrobsky/oss-gpt-20b-leetcode-finetune.git
cd oss-gpt-20b-leetcode-finetune
pip install -r requirements.txt

```






## Model Weights

The model weights are hosted on Hugging Face in multiple formats:

- **Full merged model** â€“ plug-and-play version, no adapters required.   ðŸ‘‰ [View the Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/lrobsky/gpt-oss-20b-finetuned-leetcode-merged)
- **Adapter weights (QLoRA)** â€“ lightweight, to be applied on top of the base `oss-gpt-20b`.  ðŸ‘‰ [View the Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/lrobsky/gpt-oss-20b-finetuned-leetcode)
- **GGUF quantized versions** â€“ for use with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), or [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).  **TO BE UPDATED (once available)**
